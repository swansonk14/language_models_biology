# Language Models for Biology Research

This repository accompanies the paper "Primer on Language Models for Biological Research". The Jupyter notebook, which can be opened and run online with Google Colab, demonstrates how pre-trained language models can be adapted for downstream tasks using the example of a pre-trained protein language model.
